## Project Summary
This project explores questions about the opioid crisis using a variety of datasets related to overdose rates by demographics, correlation to mental health, and prescription trends.

Potential research questions include:
- Is opioid use correlated to patient demographics such as income, mental health status, and education?
- How has the distribution of Narcan impacted opioid overdose fatality rates over time?
- What drug classes are experiencing higher overdose rates?

All datasets will be cleaned then examined with exploratory data analysis. Then, both supervised and unsupervised learning methods will be implemented to answer research questions.
