## Project Summary
Since 1999, more than 760,000 individuals have died from a drug overdose. 75% of drug overdose deaths in 2020 involved an opioid of some kind.

The opioid crisis was officially declared an emergency in 2017, and the declaration was renewed in June 2024. It is still a crisis today, taking more than 220 lives daily. 

### Research Questions Explored:
- What states have the highest rates of opioid overdoses? What factors might contribute to this?
- How are opioid overdose rates changing with time?
- Is opioid use correlated to patient demographics such as income, mental health status, and education?
- How does opioid prescription rate variability across states correlate with opioid overdose rates?
- What is the relationship between opioid use and homelessness rates in major U.S. cities?
- How has the distribution of Narcan impacted opioid overdose fatality rates over time?
- What drug classes are experiencing higher overdose rates?
- Are prescriptions for opioids increasing or decreasing over time?
- Is a drug-related death more likely to have more than one category of drugs involved? 
- How have lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies affected opioid regulation?
